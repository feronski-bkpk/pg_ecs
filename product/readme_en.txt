-- PG --
PG is a turn-based strategy in the spirit of roguelike games. The game features a variety of combinations of random dungeons, bloodthirsty monsters and unidentified items. You will have a difficult path to study the flora and fauna of this place. Be especially vigilant with local creatures, because they can be strong and cunning enough to quickly deal with you. I wish you all the best in your exploration!
